1.@Autowired:- We can use @Autowired to mark the dependency which spring is going to resolve and inject. We can use this annotation by constructor, setter and field injection.
-@Autowired has boolean argument i.e; required and default value is true. It tunes spring behavior when it doesn’t found suitable bean to wire. When required value is true exception is thrown else nothing is wired.
-If we are using constructor injection, all constructor arguments are mandatory.

2.@Bean:- it marks a factory method which instantiates a spring bean.
